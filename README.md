# Rhythm-Bullet-Hell

![Screenshot](Screenshot.png)

This was the project that I made during HackBCA V, a hackathon for high school students. In this 24-hour nonstop hackathon, students work on a project with optional workshops and activites on the side. This is what I made for the hackathon. **This is by no means representative of the neatness and efficiency of code that I usually write.** Due to the constraints of the environment (start working on the project at 6:30 pm, submit by 11:00 am), I threw efficiency and neatness of code to the bottom of my priorities. I just wanted to get what I wanted to get done, even if it were to write messy code. Even so, for the approximate 12 hours I actually spent on working this, I'm kind of proud of what I was able to get done.

As for the projct itself, I was heavily inspired by the game Just Shapes and Beats and wanted to make something similar, combining rhythm and bullet hell game elements. This was my result that I made in Unity (v2019.3.0f6)*. A build for both Windows and MacOSX is provided. Clone the repository to try it yourself! Although I am a musician, I did not make the song used in this game. The song used in this game is "TAK - PAE-KI (meganeko Remix)" by meganeko (who is an amazing artist btw). Here's a youtube video of my gameplay: https://youtu.be/SJ7Ed8Ppa1w.

*I upgraded the project to Unity v2019.3.71f1 when I pushed the Windows build into this repository. However, I didn't make any changes. I want to leave this alone as it was at the hackathon.
